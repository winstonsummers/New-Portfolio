  // work background
  `the first in my family to step out and change the way I provide for my family. I come from a family of landscapers and other blue-collar workers; before coding, I was a warehousemen. During those years in my life; I got the opportunity to lead small teams, handle negotiations, and occasionally drive business. So why code? Because my wife and I sat down one month to do a budget, back in '17, we realized that by the next year we would have to choose between paying rent or getting groceries if things didn't change. I was already the family IT guy so the next step to coding seemed natural. We found out about General Assembly from a friend of a friend and I was on my way. Now I build beautiful UIs and I know that my children and their children won't face the same struggles that we and our parents faced.`,

  // personal background
  `a Punk Rocker out of the greater Seattle area. Lots of people don't get the "punk thing," but don't be confused; I am not some rebel without a cause. Punk is all about being real, accepting yourself, and questioning things that have always been (the status quo); and that is what I am about. We are all out here just trying to get through this life, why should we be upset just because we don't have the same experiences and point of view. Soap Box Finished.`,
